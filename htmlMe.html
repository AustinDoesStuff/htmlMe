One of the easiest and least invasive is <a href="#">phone banking or canvasing</a>.  You can also get involved by looking out for local events or even hosting some yourself.</p></div>

                <div><p>An open primary is easy, all you have to do is be registered to vote and you can walk in and vote.</p></div>
                <div><p>A closed primary is hard, however, because you have to be a registered Democrat by a specific date or you can't vote in the primary. So <a href="#">check your state's local election</a> and get Grimace elected!</div>

        <div id="about">
            <div><p>Coming from the small town Des Plaines, IL, Grimace and his brother King George were raised primarily by his Great Grandmother Jenny Grimace and his Grandpa Winky.  They didn't have much money but did they best they could to instill the values that are vital to the man that he became.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace wasn't always the nice guy he is today, growing up poor, Grimace was bullied not only because of his family's economic status but also because he was overweight. Throughout his teenage years, Grimace went on a mean streak primarily stealing milkshakes until he was arrested when he was 15.
                    After his arrest, Grimace started turning his life around.  He pulled his grades up where he got a full ride to SIUE.  After graduating Cum Laude with a Bachelor's in Political Science he later finished law school at Princeton.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace's political career started shortly after, the first campaign that Grimace worked one was a civil right's campaign for children's rights.  The incumbent, Senator and former Navy Colenal Sanders was attempting to pass a bill creating less regulations on playplace safety.
                    Sanders looked to allow children to not wear socks while in the Playplace but Grimace stood against it and was instrumental in stopping the bill, preventing countless skin diseases.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace now stands on the side of safety, equality, justice, and freedom.  He stands with the working family, breakfast all-day, and the McRib year round.</p></div>
