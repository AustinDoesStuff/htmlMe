        </div>
        <div> <img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2036aa374fd6ef0f07dfd28cd505450d-c?convert_to_webp=true" alt="" /></div>
        <div id="about">
            <div><p>Coming from the small town Des Plaines, IL, Grimace and his brother King George were raised primarily by his Great Grandmother Jenny Grimace and his Grandpa Winky.  They didn't have much money but did they best they could to instill the values that are vital to the man that he became.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace wasn't always the nice guy he is today, growing up poor, Grimace was bullied not only because of his family's economic status but also because he was overweight. Throughout his teenage years, Grimace went on a mean streak primarily stealing milkshakes until he was arrested when he was 15.
                    After his arrest, Grimace started turning his life around.  He pulled his grades up where he got a full ride to SIUE.  After graduating Cum Laude with a Bachelor's in Political Science he later finished law school at Princeton.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace's political career started shortly after, the first campaign that Grimace worked one was a civil rights campaign for children.  The incumbent, Senator and former Navy Colenal Sanders was attempting to pass a bill creating less regulations on playplace safety.
                    Sanders looked to allow children to not wear socks while in the Playplace but Grimace stood against it and was instrumental in stopping the bill, preventing countless skin diseases.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace now stands on the side of safety, equality, justice, and freedom.  He stands with the working family, breakfast all-day, and the McRib year round.</p></div>

                <div><p>An open primary is easy, all you have to do is be registered to vote and you can walk in and vote.</p></div>
                <div><p>A closed primary is hard, however, because you have to be a registered Democrat by a specific date or you can't vote in the primary. So <a href="#">check your state's local election</a> and get Grimace elected!</div>

            <div><p>Grimace believes that the current "War on Socks" is a failed policy.  The current policy states that a free and open use of socks is what is best in the playplace.
                    While the current "War on Socks" policy gives the illusion of freedom, the only freedom it gives is the freedom of sickness.</p></div>
            <div><p>Since the "War on Socks" Policy was put in place <a href="#">skin rashes and irritation have been up 35%.</a>  The healthcare lobby has poured more than <a href="#">$200000</a>
                    into that bill to ensure it passed.  Grimace promises to put an end to it.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace's plan includes enforcing socks in every Playplace to help prevent skin infections.  Best of all, socks will provided if you don't have socks when you come in.</p></div>

        <div id="mcNugParagraph">
            <div><p>Grimace has a strong belief that there should be no new nugget shapes.  Currently McNuggets come in four shapes:
            <ul>
                <li>Boot</li>
                <li>Bell</li>

            <ul>
            </p></div>
            <div><p>The addition of a new shape not only would compromise the integrity of the current state of McNuggets but would create new
            outsourcing to get it created.  Grimace is for the working people and outsourcing the new shape only benefits the company, not the
            working class.</p></div>

            wish to play together regardless of their toys.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace will allow for unisex toys but will not stand in the way if a child wants to have traditionally male or female toy.

            let the public know.</p></div>

            <div><p>As of 2017 <a href="#">6 people own more wealth than 50% of the world's population.</a> While this is a global problem, Grimace sees
                    it happening more and more each and every day.  Grimace wants to help close that gap so that way if you work a full work week, you
                    can support yourself.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace's plan is a 3 part plan:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Raise the minimum wage</li>
                        <li>Make the McRib year round</li>
                        <li>Open the Ice Cream Machine all night</li>
                    </ol></p></div>
            <div><p>Raising wages is the obvious solution and when the lowest worker's wage goes up, so does everyone's!  But the question on everyone's
                    mind is how will it be paid for?  By keeping the McRib year round and keeping the ice cream machine open 24/7, it becomes obvious that
                    there would be so much excess profit that affording to pay the workers more would be profitable.</p></div>

                     for the customer, and a faster experience means more customers which leads to more profit thus higher wages.</p></div>

                    he thinks that the children are going to pay for it.</p></div>
            <div><p>Grimace believes that there should be an easier path between the resturant and the Playplace because the only reason the children sneak into
                    the resturant is because it offers greater amminities such as:
                    <ul>
